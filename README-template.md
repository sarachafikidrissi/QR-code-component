## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learnt how to use CSS Flexbox , and also how to apply media queries to add some responsiveness on the page.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 760px) {

    .container {
        width: 45%;
        padding: 0.8rem;
    }
    h1 {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
    }
}
```



### Continued development

I would like to continue learning about Responsivness more so i can apply it on next projects
